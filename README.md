# tinker-sandbox

Is the sandbox portion of Tinker. It takes a user's input through a `POST`
request and mashes it all together into output.

## Usage

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/tinker/tinker-sandbox.git
$ cd tinker-sandbox
$ npm install
$ cp config-sample.json config.json
```

At this point you'll want to open the `config.json` in your editor and configure
it to your liking.
